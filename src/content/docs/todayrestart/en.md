## 1. Core Philosophy: "The Courage to Start Again"

While existing habit apps emphasize "Streaks" and make you feel like a failure even if you miss a single day, **Today Restart** is different.

- **Resilience**: Success is measured by the **number of times you "Started Again"** after stopping, rather than consecutive days.
- **Safe Zone**: No servers, no accounts, no sync. It is a private space saved only on your phone, free from comparison or ranking.
- **Anti-Obsession**: We don't highlight missed days in red or give penalties. Whenever you return, your journey line simply continues.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Habit Creation

Start a new good habit with ease.

- **Name & Icon**: Enter what you want to do and pick a cute icon. (e.g., Drink a Glass of Water, 1-Minute Meditation)
- **Schedule**: It doesn't have to be every day. Choose only the days you feel comfortable with.
- **Notifications**: Receive supportive reminders at your chosen time. Our messages are warm and encouraging, never pressuring.
- **Quick Start Templates**: Not sure where to start? Use templates like "1-Minute English" or "Walk" to get going instantly.

### 2.2 Today's Check

Once you've finished your task for the day, tap the **[Done]** button on the home screen.

- **Toggle Feature**: Made a mistake? Tap again to cancel. No pressure.
- **Dashboard**: Check the overall flow of your day with the completion gauge at the top of the screen.

### 2.3 My Journey (Journey Line)

In the habit detail screen, you'll see a **"Journey Line"** instead of standard checkmarks.

- **Connected Journey**: We connect your first check-in and your latest check-in with a single line. Even if you miss a few days, **the line remains unbroken.** This is proof that you haven't given up and are still on your journey.
- **Restart Count**: See how many times you had the courage to come back this month. This number represents your true willpower.

### 2.4 Widgets (iOS Widget)

Check off habits directly from your home screen without even opening the app.

- **Simplified Check**: Complete your daily habit with a single tap on the widget.
- **Encouraging Phrases**: You'll be greeted with messages like "Restart Today" or "Just One Minute."

## 3. Settings & Personalization

**Today Restart** offers detailed settings to minimize psychological burden.

- **Display Settings**:
  - **Show Streak**: (Default: OFF) If the streak count feels like pressure, you can keep it hidden.
  - **Show Incomplete**: (Default: OFF) If you don't want to see "missed" days as empty gaps, you can hide them.
- **Remove Ads**: If banner ads are distracting, you can make a one-time purchase to "Remove Ads" for a permanently clean experience.

## 4. Data & Privacy

- **100% Local Storage**: All data is stored only on your iPhone. There's no risk of privacy leaks or data harvesting.
- **No Login Required**: No need to create an account. Start as soon as you install.
- **Important Note**: If you delete the app, all records stored on the device will be lost. (A data export/import feature is planned for a future update.)

## 5. Warm Tips

- **Start Very Small**: "1-Minute Stretching" is more powerful than a 30-minute workout.
- **It's Okay to Forget**: Whether it's been a few days or weeks, it's fine. The moment you open the app and tap the button, your journey continues.
- **The App Never Judges**: The messages at the top of the screen respect your pace. "Go at your own pace today."
